The solution is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible.  This often involves refactoring your CSS to resolve specificity issues using more specific selectors or adjusting the order of your CSS declarations:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; 
}

.parent .child .grandchild {
  color: yellow;
}
```

In this revised version, the specificity of the selectors ensures the correct color inheritance and avoids the need for `!important`. If `!important` absolutely is required, use it judiciously in a well-documented and organized manner.
