# CSS Specificity and !important Declaration Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic issue related to CSS specificity and the use of the `!important` declaration.  The example highlights how `!important` can unexpectedly override styles based on the order of declarations and selector specificity, even when more specific selectors are used.  It's a common pitfall for developers not fully understanding how these mechanisms interact.

## Understanding the Problem

The `!important` declaration, while offering a seemingly simple way to override styles, often leads to hard-to-debug issues when used without careful consideration. It disrupts the normal CSS cascading rules, making it harder to predict which styles will take precedence.

## Solution

The best solution is to avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary.  In the majority of cases, resolving specificity conflicts by carefully adjusting the selector or its order is a much better practice. If `!important` is unavoidable, ensure meticulous attention to both its usage and to the proper ordering of rules.
